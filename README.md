# Finger-Kinematic-Analysis

As the title suggests, this is the MATLAB code for the kinematic analysis for a prosthetic finger. Based upon real world data, the program conducts kinematics analysis to discover the posture, velocity, and acceleration of the finger tip throughout. The purpose is to seek reasonable values for the above-mentioned and to justify if the force that the finger generates is sufficient for everyday purposes. 

This is the code - kinematics analysis for a prosthetic finger. There are main 3 catagories of files uploaded:

1. Calculation codes of the posture, velocity, and acceleration: Intervals (main calculation for posture analysis with collected values from 3D model) and loops (custom functions used for part of the calculation).

2. Data files: Calculated values store to make plotting easier (tagged with x/y/a/v/T).

3. Plotting: Uses the data files to plot the results for presentation purposes (D_Plot, ForceRatio).
